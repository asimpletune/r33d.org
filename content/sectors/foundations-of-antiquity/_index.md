This page is a part of the [public sector](/#public-sectors) series, offered by the [Public Works](/) book club.
It is a work in progress that serves to organize information, across different textual works, about the early part of [classical antiquity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_antiquity).
The time periods covered by this page begins with the resurgence of Greek writing and the first [Olympic Games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Olympic_Games) (Ὀλυμπιακοὶ ἀγῶνες) in __776 BCE__, around the time of [Homer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homer) (Ὅμηρος), and ends with the death of [King Philip II of Macedon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_II_of_Macedon) (Φίλιππος), in __336 BCE__ , around the time of [Aristotle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle) (Ἀριστοτέλης).

This corresponds roughly to the [Archaic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaic_Greece) and [Classical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_Greece) Periods of ancient Greece _(although the rise of [Alexander the Great](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_the_Great) (Ἀλέξανδρος) falls within the Classical Period, we will be cover it in a follow up [public sector](/#public-sectors))_.

## Historical Context

### Neolithic Greece and Earlier

Humans have been in Greece for over 200,000 years, where the earliest *Homo sapiens* remains outside of Africa have been discovered. The earliest evidence of the domestication of cats was [discovered in Cyprus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestication_of_the_cat#Archaeological_evidence) around 9500 BCE. It is upon the emergence of farming around __7000 BCE__ that we mark the beginning of [Neolithic Greece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neolithic_Greece) __(c. 7000 – c. 3200 BCE)__. This is the earliest evidence of farming in Europe, most likely due to Greece's close proximity to Asia.

### Bronze Age (c. 3200 – c. 1200 BCE)

#### Minoan Civilization (c. 3200 – c. 1100 BCE)

The [Bronze Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_Age) in Greece begins with the [Minoans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minoan_civilization) c. 3200 BCE, on the island of Crete and other Aegean Islands, called thus by archeologists after the mythical [King Minos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minos) (Μίνως). These people are considered the "first link" in the European chain, and are considered the oldest advanced civilization in Europe, due to the large palaces they built and left behind, the largest of which is [Knossos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knossos) (Κνωσός). There is evidence between c. 1800 BCE and c. 1450 BCE of a potential Minoan writing system called [Linear A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_A). Their civilization experienced a a slow decline starting c. 1550 BCE, for reasons that are still unclear, although the timeline corresponds roughly with the rise of the [Mycenaean Civilization](#mycenaean-civilization-c-1750-c-1050-bc), as well as the [volcanic eruption of Thera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minoan_eruption), which is modern day Santorini.

It was this volcanic eruption that buried the nearby Minoan settlement of [Akrotiri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akrotiri_(prehistoric_city)), leaving the ruins remarkably well-preserved, similar to the famous [Pompeii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pompeii) well over a thousand years after it.

}}

#### Mycenaean Civilization (c. 1750 – c. 1050 BC)

Another important civilization belonged to the [Mycenaeans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycenaean_Greece), who were part of the last phase of the Bronze Age in Ancient Greece, roughly coinciding with the mythical and quasi-historical [Trojan War](#trojan-war-c-1200-bce). Unlike the [Minoans](#minoan-civilization-c-3200-c-1100-bce), the Mycenaeans were from the main continent, who expanded their influence to the surrounding islands.

#### Trojan War (c. 1200 BCE)

The [Trojan War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trojan_War) is the subject of the Homeric epic poem [The Iliad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iliad) (Ἰλιάς), telling the story of a protracted Greek siege of the city of [Troy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troy) (Ίλιον), after [Paris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_(mythology)) (Πάρις) of Troy took [Helen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helen_of_Troy) (Ἑλένη), the wife of [King Menelaus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menelaus) (Μενέλαος) of Sparta away. The city of Troy eventually falls, due to the cunning [Odyssey's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odysseus) (Ὀδυσσεύς) Trojan Horse. The exact date of the Trojan war is unknown, but the best sources of antiquity believed it be c. 1184 BCE, which was determined by [Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eratosthenes) (Ἐρατοσθένης). To the ancient Greeks, the war existed somewhere between being the last event of the mythical age and the first event of the historical age.

#### Bronze Age Collapse (c. 1200 - c. 1150)

Beginning around the time period that roughly corresponds, incidentally, with the fall of Troy, there was a sudden and widespread societal collapse across the eastern Mediterranean. Virtually every Mediterranean empire except for the Egyptians saw their cities violently destroyed or abandoned. This event precipitated brought about the [Greek Dark Ages](#the-greek-dark-ages).

There were many contributing factors to such a large scale event, including climate change, natural disasters, diseases, economic collapse, and migrations of new populations into the areas. One notable example of this were the invasions of the "[Sea Peoples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_Peoples)".

The Egyptian [Pharoh Ramsesses III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramesses_III) was able to successfully repel the invading "Sea Peoples" at the [Battle of Delta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Delta) c. 1175 BCE.
